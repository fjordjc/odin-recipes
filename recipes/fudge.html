        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>I double the recipe and put in a glass baking dish (9x13 inches). Nice for holidays... Keep it for a secret and family and friends will think you worked forever on it... You can also use peanut butter chips and make peanut butter fudge.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
            <li>1 14 oz. can sweetened condensed milk</li>
            <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
            <li>1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Place chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, and butter or margarine in large microwaveable bowl. Zap in microwave on medium until chips are melted, about 3-5 minute, stirring once or twice during cooking. Stir in nuts, if desired.</li>
            <li>Pour into well-greased 8x8-inch glass baking dish. Refrigerate until set.</li>
        </ol>
